For the HCI course 'Multi-Modal Interaction' we had to come up with a research project incorporating multiple modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, tactile). We researched the possibilities of evacuating based on auditory and visual cues in a digital environment. 
Within this project I was responsible for creating a digital floor plan of a realistic building. There were a few difficulties incorporating the map in a realistic way in our software platform, which required close communication between me and the programmer and changing the layout multiple times based on feedback. I was also responsible for researching the possibilities of virtual versus physical testing of this system, which concluded to using a virtual simulation instead of navigating in a real building, since indoor navigation technology was not viable within the scope of the project.

What I learned from this project most is the importance of staying in close contact with the other group members to make sure everyone is on the same track. When working with new software platforms it is also important to keep flexible, since not all things work out as intended. This was an interesting continual problem solving challenge with close team collaborating.
