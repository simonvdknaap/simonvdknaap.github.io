For the HCI course 'Interaction Technology and Innovation' we had to come up with a magical solution for a common morning routine struggle. We came up with the UnfORBgettable: a globe which would let the user know which Bluetooth beacons, connected to important items, where present when leaving their home for work. 
Within this project I was responsible for figuring out how we could keep track of the beacons' addresses whilst these kept changing for enhanced privacy. This was an unforeseen challenge which I was able to tackle by 'listening' for the addresses nearby and manually note and thereafter recognise the pattern in the changing addresses. I was also responsible for connecting all sensors and other components in such a way that everything could fit inside of the base, which required careful planning of the perfboard layout and order of soldering and installation. For this I had to make sure all sensors could be connected pins of the ESP32 that supported their functionality, to succeed I made multiple iterations of the design before soldering it all together.

What I also learned from this project most is that whilst working with electronics, it is important to thoroughly research components beforehand to make sure they are able to operate in unison, as well as how to solder these components in a predefined, planned order to make it fit in a very small area.
