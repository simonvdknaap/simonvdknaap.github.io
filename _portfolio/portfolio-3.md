From a young age I am experimenting with automatic lighting, and in recent years also with climate control, intuitive control and collaboration of independent devices to enhance the functionality of already-present appliances as well as energy savings.

What I am learning from this project most is that whilst working with electronics, it is important to thoroughly research components beforehand to make sure they are able to operate in unison, as well as how to solder these components in a predefined, planned order to make it fit in a very small area.
