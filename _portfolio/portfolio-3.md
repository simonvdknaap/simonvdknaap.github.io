From a young age I am experimenting with automatic lighting, and in recent years also with climate control, intuitive control and collaboration of independent devices to enhance the functionality of already-present appliances as well as energy savings. Since the possibilities are almost endless in combining parts to create a system that functions as wanted, there is something for every skill level and time dedication to learn how electronics and open-source software works.

What I am learning from this project most is that whilst working with electronics and software created by different companies, it is almost always possible to create a working and even pleasant system of parts. Even though it's a lot of tinkering, both physically as with the software components, the end result that is (mostly) working makes up for it. It's the mindset of not accepting no as an answer and then eventually solving the problem at hand that fills me with joy. This motivates me to scale up to even bigger projects.
