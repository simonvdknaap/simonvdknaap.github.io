I am Simon van der Knaap, a Human Computer Interaction student at Utrecht University. From a young age I've been intrigued by how interactive technology can enhance human communication and simplify information-driven actions. I was blown away by the intuitiveness of Apple's ecosystem, the use of cloud-computing to collaborate and the rise of open source software communities not needing companies to create beautiful products, as well as 3D printing to bridge the gap to the physical environment.

In my adult life, my attitude towards the trend of adding ever-more 'functionality' to online platforms shifted. Companies that wanted to lock people to their platforms by making it almost impossible to delete accounts, by not allowing one to transfer content or purchases from one platform to another, and collecting user data to personalise each user's experience on the platform which actively leads to unwanted polarisation and even radicalisation, without communicating any of this use of personal (interaction) information for this goal openly to the user. This results in more time spent on the platform so companies started to use this tactic wherever possible to boost engagement.
These strategies made me realise the importance of truly beneficial and functional interaction design, especially for services that are practically public services in current society. This is why I started the Masters programme of HCI after finishing the bachelor Information Science at the University of Amsterdam. 

Nowadays, artificial intelligence is added to most digital interfaces in a general manner to 'enhance the experience' by just being present, but not serving a pre-defined or user-requested purpose. This feels aimless, lacks focus on a user's task at hand and hinders intuitive interaction for most. Besides negative effects on the interface, these additions come at a cost as well. These models need vast amounts of electrical, compute and cooling power, as well as unimaginable amounts of training data (which companies acquire without consent from copyright holders), all of which should be assessed to result in a quantifiable better product experience whilst mitigating their negative effects. Therefore careful consideration before and reflection after implementation is even more important than before to make sure these 'tools' do not degrade the experience, ethics and usability of the interface.

Don't get me wrong. I know we cannot stop the development, implementation and usage of AI tools. Most of you will use it regularly and want to keep using it, but it needs to have a clear function. And right now, offering it to everyone and everywhere, it does not. It degrades one's ability to think critically, hinders learning new skills, limits the need of social interaction and help spread misinformation to even further destabilise society. This further stresses the importance of HCI professionals like myself who want to serve society with their skill and time.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
